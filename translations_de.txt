Das ist besonders nützlich für Kreaturen, die hohe Benommenheits-Regeneration oder viel Leben haben.",
en:  "The compound bow is slightly better than the bow, but doesn't exceed the crossbow in dealing torpor. Therefore it is not the most efficient bow for taming.",
de:  "Der Kompositbogen ist etwas besser als der Bogen, überschreitet jedoch die Armbrust nicht im Zufügen von Benommenheit. Er ist also nicht der effizienteste Bogen zum Zähmen.",

de:  "Der Skorpion macht seine Gegner in einer Zeitspanne von 10 Sekunden benommen. In diesen 10 Sekunden kannst du deinem Ziel nicht erneut Benommenheit hinzufügen. Wenn du dich entscheidest innerhalb dieser 10 Sekunden anzugreifen, wirst du lediglich normalen Schaden machen. ",
en:  "The Arthropluera's main attack deals torpor damage and can therefore be used for taming. However, the torpor is applied to the target in a timespan of 10 seconds and the torpor attacks do not stack in this case. The Arthropluera is slightly better than the scorpion for knocking creatures out.",
de:  "Arthropluera's Hauptattacke besitzt Benommenheitsschaden und kann demnach zum Zähmen verwendet werden. Allerdings wird die Benommenheit in einer Zeitspanne von 10 Sekunden hinzugefügt und stapelt sich in diesem Falle nicht. Arthropluera ist etwas besser dazu geeignet, Lebewesen zu zähmen als der Skorpion.",
en:  "Much like the scorpion, the Beelzebufo applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage. Furthermore, the Beelzebufo has two types of attacks which do different amounts of torpor damage. The left mousebutton attack (shoot out tonque) will result in less torpor damage, and is denoted by the maximum amount of licks you will need. Alternatively, the right mousebutton attack (tonque swing) is denoted by the minimum amount of licks.",
de:  "So wie der Skorpion, fügt auch Beelzebufo seinem Ziel in einer Zeitspanne von 10 Sekunden Benommenheit zu. In diesen 10 Sekunden kannst du deinem Ziel nicht erneut Benommenheit hinzufügen. Wenn du dich entscheidest innerhalb dieser 10 Sekunden anzugreifen, wirst du lediglich normalen Schaden machen. Außerdem besitzt Beelzebufo zwei Arten von Attacken, welche eine verschiedene Menge an Benommenheitsschaden besitzen. Die Attacke der linken Maustaste (herausschnellende Zunge) fügt weniger Benommenheit hinzu und ist demnach die maximale Anzahl an benötigten Attacken. Alternativ, die Attacke der rechten Maustaste (Schwingen der Zunge), ist die minimale Anzahl an benötigten Attacken.",
en:  "The pachy has two kinds of attacks, charged and non-charged, that both do instant torpor damage to the target. The charged attack, indicated by the minimum amount of blows, does much more torpor damage than the non-charged attack, however the attack is hard to steer in the right direction.",
de:  "Der Pachy hat zwei Arten von Attacken, eine stürmende und eine nicht stürmende. Beide fügen dem Ziel direkte Benommenheit zu. Die stürmende Attacke ist, angezeigt als die minimale ANzahl an benötigten Attacken, fügt mehr Benommenheit hinzu, als die nicht stürmende. Allerdings ist es schwieriger diese Attacke in die richtige Richtung zu steuern.",

//Timer explanation
en:  "Why starve taming?",
de:  "", 
en:  "To get things straight: starve taming does not have any influence on the total time your tame will take. Instead, it is mostly used to minimize risk on important tames. The advantage of starve taming is that you don't use food yet, meaning that you can leave a tame if it for instance gets hit (and the effectiveness gets lowered), without losing your precious kibble.",
de:  "", 
en:  "How does the starve timer work?",
de:  "", 
en:  "First, make sure you have selected the right creature, level and food you are using for the tame.",
de:  "", 
en:  "Fill in the max food stat of the creature you have knocked unconscious in the 'Max food' field",
de:  "", 
en:  "Fill in the current food value of the creature, keep in mind that this can go down pretty quickly.",
de:  "", 
en:  "Optionally; set an alarm by checking the box and setting a value when you want to be noticed. Tip: make sure you will have enough time to get back to your game when you hear the alarm.",
de:  "", 
en:  "Press start to start the timer. You can also leave the app (and even kill it), as the timer will work in the background in those cases.",
de:  "", 
en:  "What does the target food indicate?",
de:  "", 
en:  "Some creatures will not have a high enough food stat to be fully starved. If that is the case, the target food will be negative and indicate that, when its food has reached 0, can not be tamed in one go. If this is the case, the starve timer will count down until the food has reached 0. If the creature has a high enough food stat, the target food value will indicate when the creature has lost enough food to eat everything in one go. If you've then reached this target value, fill the creature up and watch it eat everything until tamed!",
de:  "", 
en:  "How does the narcotic timer work?",
de:  "", 
en:  "Simply put, the narcotic timer counts down from the given torpor amount until 0. You only have to fill in the creature's current torpor and press start for it to work.",
de:  "", 
en:  "Tip: Make sure to set the alarm in a way that you will be able to reach the creature in time; it WILL wake up if it reaches 0.",
de:  "", 
en:  "What do the icons above the timer mean?",
de:  "", 
en:  "You can toggle between the use of narcotics and narcoberries by using the icons above the timer. This will change the indications of the amount and time needed to fully refill the creature's torpor.",

en:  "As of the latest patch, the default rates for taming, harvesting and experience have been doubled in ARK. This means that for those multipliers, setting them to 1 is equal to what was previously 2x. If you are playing on an official server, you don't have to make any changes as the app now defaults to these new \"2x rates\". However, if you're playing on a server with boosted settings, please go to Settings > Server settings and add your custom server with the new corresponding rates.",
